Data structures
---
The heightmap data (tfr transform) is rendered in blocks at different
zoomlevels, think digital map tools. Each block is queued for computation
(instead of being downloaded) when it is requested for.

These blocks have an arbitrary aspect ratio, unlike map software where the
width is always equal to the height.

After each viewport change the queue of requested blocks are reordered after
"importance" and dependencies.

There is however a constant number of data points in each dimension of a block.
Sizes of such a data point is governed by two integer zoom factors:
(delta t, delta f) = (2^tzoom, 2^fzoom) [s, 1/s]
tzoom = INT_MIN is special and always represents the same sample rate as the
original waveform. For all other tzoom, 2^-tzoom is always less than the
waveform sample rate.


Rendering
---
2D uses anisotropic filtering. Data at different mipmap levels are explicitly
provided from previously computed blocks.

3D by creating a vertex array out of the amplitudes of each block. The blocks
are rendered independently as in the 2D case.

During rendering, non-existing blocks may get requested for. A block request is
almost always successful.


Computation
---
Only the most high resolution block can be computed from sratch. That block has
the same sample rate along the t-axis as the original waveform. Resolution in
frequency is at least as high as some treshold value. Such as 10 scales per
octave for instance.

To compute other blocks, higher resolution blocks are downsampled and stored in
subdivisions of a block with the requested resolution.

Whenever a new block size is requested, it is first approximated by an
interpolation from any available lower resolution block. If no such block is
available it is sufficient to first render it black, then compute a STFT
approximation of the wavelettransform, and then compute the real
wavelettransform.


Filters
---
Filters that extract or alter data are applied when the transform is computed,
and will thus alter the rendering. To render a spectogram without having the
effects of filters visualized an empty filter chain can be passed into
Spectogram. For altering the output refer to transform-inverse.h.

The term scaleogram is not used in the source code, in favor of spectrogram.
