Debugging tests
---------------
It's quite easy to mix libraries built for debug with those built for release. So to debug a test, make sure sonicawe, gpumisc, your test, and sonicawe-end2end/common are built with debug symbols turned on.


When running individual tests outside runtests.sh you need to make sure it can find required dynamic libraries. Either by changing the PATH in windows, LD_LIBRARY_PATH in Linux and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in OS X. This path can also be added to the "Run Environment" in Qt Creator or Visual C++ (remember to change the base path .../johan/dev/sonicawe above for Visual C++).
Like so:

os x
----
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(cd ../lib/sonicawe-maclib/lib; pwd):$(cd ../src; pwd):/usr/local/cuda/lib"
echo $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH


windows bash
------------
export PATH="$PATH:$(cd ../lib/sonicawe-winlib/sonicawe_snapshot_win32_base; pwd):$(cd ../src; pwd)"
echo $PATH


windows cmd/visual c++
----------------------
PATH=%PATH%;C:\Users\johan\dev\sonicawe\lib\sonicawe-winlib\sonicawe_snapshot_win32_base;C:\Users\johan\dev\sonicawe\src\debug


ubuntu
------
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(cd ../lib/sonicawe-ubuntulib/lib; pwd):$(cd ../src; pwd)"
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
