/**
  Both a sink and a source at the same time. Well, yes. Like an iostream.

  You insert data with 'SinkSource::put(pBuffer)', it will be located where the
  buffer sais the data is. If the SinkSource already contains data for that
  location it will be overwritten.

  There are two different accept strategies that sais whether put should deny
  parts of incomming buffers or not. put accepts anything while
  putExpectedSamples discards all data that has not previously been marked as
  exptected by invalidate_samples. Expected samples are given by
  'invalid_samples()'.

  Afterwards, any data put into the SinkSource can be fetched with
  'SinkSource::read'. If the read Interval starts at a location where no data
  has been put zeros will be returned for that section. Otherwise 'read' will
  return a block from its internal cache that includes 'Interal::first' but
  could otherwise be both much larger and much smaller than the requested
  length. Use 'Source::readFixedLength' if you need specific samples.
