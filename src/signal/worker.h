/**
Signal::Worker is a queue of ranges, that might be worked off by one or
multiple threads (and hence one or multiple GPUs). The calling thread
calls Worker::workOne as a blocking operation performing the following
steps:

1. Ask pOperation Signal::Worker::_source for a pBuffer over some samples.
2. The pBuffer is sent to the callback(s).

--- Design motivation for Signal::Worker ---
Heightmap rendering and Playback both needs to read from Signal::Source::read.
But neither are allowed to do so directly because 'read' is a blocking
operation.

At a first glance Playback could afford read as a blocking operation as
Playback is run asynchronously anyway in a separate thread. But it is
impossible to guarantee that 'read' is fast enough (i.e. returns more than
"Source::sample_rate" samples per second). Also cuda kernel invocations
are also blocking, meaning that the entire operating system user interface
will be locked while the kernel executes. These issues call for an
asynchronous solution that makes sure that kernel invocations are fast
enough for a responsive UI, yet big enough for efficient computations.

--- Solution ---
Signal::Source::read is called by an asynchronous worker thread instead.
Playback is notified via Signal::Sink::put( pBuffer, pOperation ) as a callback
function by registering itself as a Signal::Sink in tfr-worker. Tr::Waveform
is notified by the same callback. Heightmap rendering is also notified by the
same callback and will have to compute the cwt of the Buffer, unless
dynamic_cast<CwtFilter*>(source.get())==true in which case Heightmap
rendering can reuse the cwt previously computed in the CwtFilter.

These callbacks are invoked by different threads if there are multiple GPUs
available, one thread per GPU and CUDA context. The callback may use any CUDA
objects reachable through Buffer or Source for further computations. If such
computations are heavy they will affect the total time for each loop iteration
in Signal::Worker and thus the size of chunk reads will be adjusted to reach
the desired framerate. Also note that OpenGL rendering requires data to be
transfered from CUDA via host memory (CPU RAM) unless the main thread doing
OpenGL rendering is the same as the thread invoking the callback. Use
Gpumisc::ThreadChecker or QThread to decide if data needs to be moved over to
the CPU.

--- Example ---
This is an example tree of signal operations. Rendering is placed at the first
none-GroupOperation, a GroupOperation doesn't affect the flow but merely keeps
a couple of operations together for more meaningful rendering. A MergeOperation
is a GroupOperation which starts with a pure source (not an operation on a
previous source) and then superimposes the previous source with the source
created by the GroupOperation.

1/ GroupOperation: MergeOperation Root
9 Operation remove section [Rendering]
8 Operation: Amplitude*0.5
7 CwtFilter: remove ellipse
6 GroupOperation: move selection in frequency
  2 Operation: merge extracted selection at new location in time
  2 CwtFilter: resample at new frequency
  1 CwtFilter: extract selection
5 GroupOperation: move selection in time
  2 Operation: merge extracted selection at new location in time
  1 CwtFilter: extract selection
4 Operation: remove section
3 Operation: remove section
2 GroupOperation: move section
  3 Operation: remove section
  2 GroupOperation: copy section
    1 Operation: merge source
  1 Operation: insert silence
1 Source: Recording

The pOperation for Signal::Worker can be set to any pOperation and results are fed to
the callbacks when they are ready. Note that if the source is changed while
Playback is active, sound will be heard from the new source at the same
location in time. Playback will not remember its entire previous tree.

If there is an underfed playback (bool Playback::is_underfed()), Playback is
prioritized and sets the todo_list in Signal::Worker. Otherwise; if it is not
underfed, some rendering can be done and Heightmap can set the todo_list
instead. It is up to the global rendering loop to determine which has higher
priority.

If one of the receiving sinks is underfed, worker will not take smaller
chunks and will not skip working even if the requested frame rate is
higher than the actual achieved framerate.
