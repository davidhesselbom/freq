            its own cuda context and data can't be transfered between cuda contexts
            without first going to the cpu. Therefore a 'cpu_copy' is kept in CPU
            memory so that the block data is readily available for merging new
            blocks. Only one GPU may access 'cpu_copy' at once. The OpenGL textures
            are updated from cpu_copy whenever new_data_available is set to true.

            For single-GPU environments, 'cpu_copy' is not used.
